Design and build a fully functional web-based multiplayer word puzzle game inspired by Wordscapes, with a bluish magical design aesthetic. Players will form words from a circle of letters to fill out crossword-style puzzles. The game should support multiplayer, track high scores via leaderboards, and allow players to customize settings. All components should be beautifully aligned, responsive, and visually complete.
